# Code Computerlove pre-screening exercise 1

This is a simple project that asks the user for their name and then tells them their fortune.

Please complete the following steps:

1. Show the user the fortune on the day they were born.

E.G.

```
What's your name? Bob
When were you born (dd/mm/yyyy)? 01/01/1980
Hi Bob!
Your fortune for today is: Newlyweds should be avoided!
On the day you were born your fortune was: Beware of figs!
```

2. If today is the user's birthday wish them a happy birthday.

E.G.

```
What's your name? Bob
When were you born (dd/mm/yyyy)? 01/01/1980
Happy birthday, Bob!
Your fortune for today is: Newlyweds should be avoided!
On the day you were born your fortune was: Beware of figs!
```

## Notes and hints

If you are familiar with test driven development, please feel free to write tests. You can use any unit testing or mocking libraries of your choice.

You will probably need to wrap `Console` in order to get it under test. See `DateTimeOffsetWrapper` for an example.
